# CHAPTER 8: Property-based testing

- The general idea of such a library is to decouple the specification of program behavior from the creation of test cases.
- The programmer focuses on specifying the behavior of programs and giving high-level constraints on the test cases.
- The framework then automatically generates test cases that satisfy these constraints, and runs tests to ensure that programs behave as specified.
