# CHAPTER 1: What is functional programming?


- Construct our programs using only pure functions - in other words, functions that have no side effects.
- Side effects:
  - Modifying a variable
  - Modifying a data structure in place
  - Setting a field on an object
  - Throwing an exception or halting with an error
  - Printing to the console or reading user input
  - Reading from or writing to a file
  - Drawing on the screen
