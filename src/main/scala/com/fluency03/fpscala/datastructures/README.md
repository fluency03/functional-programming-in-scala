# CHAPTER 3: Functional data structures

- Remember, a pure function must not change data in place or perform other side effects. Therefore, functional data structures are by definition **immutable**.
- Doesnâ€™t this mean we end up doing a lot of extra copying of the data? Perhaps surprisingly, the answer is *no*.
- A `trait` is an abstract interface that may optionally contain implementations of some methods.
- Adding `sealed` in front means that all implementations of the `trait` must be declared in this file.
- **Algebraic data type (ADT)** is just a data type defined by one or more data constructors, each of which may contain zero or more arguments.
- Pairs and tuples of other arities are also algebraic data types.
